### WARNING:
There are games on this website that you are allowed to play. PLEASE do not play these games during class time and focus on the work you are doing.
School districts will block games if you are playing them during class time excessively and making teachers mad. To make the school district not block games, only play games during times where teachers allow you to.

### TEACHERS/DISTRICT NOTICE:
Hello there teachers and the school district currently viewing this from an external application such as GoGuardian. I created this website to allow hard working students to play games when allowed by teachers.
This site is NOT intended to be a bypassed game website, it is supposed to be a games website that students can play after they do their work. I do not encourage playing games while doing work. Thank you for understanding.
Also, I formally request that you do NOT block this site. Anyone using this site is using it responsibly.

### PLAYING GAMES TUTORIAL:
To play games, use one of the following links below! These are all school appropriate games, so you can't get in trouble for them.
Please note that if you are caught playing games during work time, teachers can have the site you are using blocked on GoGuardian.

Sites like classwork.cc were blocked on GoGuardian because people played them way too much during class. To avoid this site being blocked, please don't play this during class.

### WHAT IS THIS?
This is the open source repository for my games site. I use this to play games responsibly and not during class.
Are you a teacher at CHS and you have an issue with this site? Please contact me via [my email](mailto:tlhughlett@student.cacsk12.org) and I will be sure to sort things out.
